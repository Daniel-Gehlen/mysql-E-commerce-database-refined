**Report on the Development and Refinement of the E-Commerce Database**

**Introduction**

The E-Commerce database was developed to store information related to an online store, including customers, products, orders, deliveries, payments, and suppliers. Throughout the development, various queries were implemented to provide useful insights into the stored data.

**Methods**

Initially, the database was designed with the following main tables: `customers`, `orders`, `deliveries`, `products`, `order_items`, and `payments`. Each table was carefully designed to store relevant data and ensure referential integrity between them.

Queries were developed to perform operations such as simple data retrieval, filtering with the `WHERE` clause, calculations of derived attributes, sorting with `ORDER BY`, grouping filters with `HAVING`, and joins between tables to provide a more comprehensive perspective of the data.

During development, areas for improvement were identified, and new requirements emerged, leading to refinements in the database design and implementation of queries.

**Results**

The database was refined with the addition of new tables, such as `suppliers` and `inventory`, to improve data representation and support more complex queries.

The queries were enhanced to provide more detailed analysis and valuable insights into business performance, such as the number of orders per customer, the relationship between sellers and suppliers, product stock per supplier, and the list of products supplied by each supplier.

**Conclusion**

The E-Commerce database underwent a continuous process of development and refinement to meet the business needs and provide relevant information for decision-making. The developed queries are powerful tools for data analysis and can be used to monitor the performance of the online store, identify sales trends, and optimize internal processes.

**Case Study**

Imagine an e-commerce company that wants to analyze the sales performance of its products over the past year. Using the E-Commerce database and the developed queries, the company can:

- Determine the best-selling products over the past year.
- Identify the customers who made the most purchases and the products they purchased the most.
- Analyze the order history to understand purchasing patterns over time.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and promotions based on generated sales.

With this information, the company can adjust its business strategy, optimize product inventory, and focus on areas with the highest growth potential.
